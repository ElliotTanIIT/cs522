# CS 522 hate speech project
## Evaluating the effectiveness of GPT-2 generated hate speech for SVM and BERT hate speech classification

The aim is to see if using GPT-2 generated data to train a predictive hate speech model will improve the accuracy of the model. The models we will be building are from using SVM and BERT. We will be comparing the effects of different amounts of GPT-2 generated data on the accuracy of the model. This project will be completed in python and run on google Colab.
