# CS 522 hate speech project
## Evaluating the effectiveness of GPT-2 generated hate speech for SVM and BERT hate speech classification

### Problem Statement

The aim is to see if using GPT-2 generated data to train a predictive hate speech model will improve the accuracy of the model. 

### Methodology

The models we will be building are from using SVM and BERT. We will be comparing the effects of different amounts of GPT-2 generated data on the accuracy of the model. This project will be completed in python and run on google Colab. In order to utilize the data sets properly, much cleaning and pre-processing was done on them. Please read the final report for more details.
